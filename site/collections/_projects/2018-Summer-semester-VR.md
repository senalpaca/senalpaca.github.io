This project was the first project of my studies. I was very interested in VR and&nbsp; not just wanted to gain practical knowledge about the development processes but also learn more about the VR technologies and its capabilities.&nbsp;

With the project Data Visualization in VR the goal was to represent a form of data of our choice in a VR environment created by us. The data chosen to represent was temperature. To visualize temperature a VR environment consisting of four rooms corresponding to four seasons was created. Other than implementing rain and snowing effects, to give the user a feeling of coldness or heat several ideas such as freezing the eye view was implemented. Although the environment was interactive and the user is able to change the setting by grabbing and moving the meshes, there are no tasks to complete.&nbsp;

The project was created using the Unreal Engine 4 and the meshes used in the room were created using Blender. The VR equipment was provided by the Technical University of Berlin and the set-up was done by the group.&nbsp;

The project was designed, developed, implemented and tested by a group of four people. The task division was same for everybody, so that all four of use had the chance to participate in each development process.
