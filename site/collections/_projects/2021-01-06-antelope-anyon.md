CrashSim is a game created as a project in context of the module "Interdisciplinary Media Project" during my bachelor studies.&nbsp;

The motivation behind this project was to create an educational game to represent a digital occupation. The game CrashSim was inspired by the research group Forensic Architecture. . With its projects, installations, research and work in general FA is very inspiring and one of a kind in its field. Their work paves the way for using different technologies in the field of human rights and is an important example of interdisciplinarity among fields. I have been following Forensic Architecture for years and am very interested in their research, therefore it was a very exciting project to develop for me.&nbsp;

CrashSim is a 2D simulation type of game, where the player will take on the role of a specialist who works in the IT Forensics, specifically in the traffic accident reconstruction field. It’s a single-player game, that is designed for PC. The purpose of the character is to correctly reconstruct an accident and solve the case. With CrashSim the goal was to introduce the interdisciplinary field called car accident forensics to the user and simulate a very simple experience of being a forensic expert in this field. In order to integrate the interdisciplinarity there were other aspects involved such as conversations with different experts like lawyers, police officers or witness interviews. The game was created using Unity.

The game was designed, developed, created&nbsp; and evaluated by four people, namely André Desch, Nomingerel Tsogtsaikhan, Sena Dogan and Süleyman Yalcinkaya. All four people were involved in every step of its implementation and usability testing.
