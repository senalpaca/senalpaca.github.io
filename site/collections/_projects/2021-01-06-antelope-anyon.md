CrashSim is a game created as a project in context of the module "Interdisciplinary Media Project" during my bachelor studies.&nbsp;

The motivation behind this project was to create an educational game to represent a digital occupation. The game CrashSim was inspired by the research group Forensic Architecture. . With its projects, installations, research and work in general FA is very inspiring and one of a kind in its field. Their work paves the way for using different technologies in the field of human rights and is an important example of interdisciplinarity among fields. I have been following Forensic Architecture for years and am very interested in their research, therefore int it was a very exciting project to develop for me.&nbsp;

With CrashSim the goal was to introduce the interdisciplinary field called car accident forensics to the user and simulate a very simple experience of being a forensic expert in this field. In order to integrate the interdisciplinarity there were other aspects involved such as conversations with different experts like lawyers, police officers or witness interviews. The game was created using Unity.

Praeteritis, inquit, gaudeo. Praeteritis, inquit, gaudeo. Quod, inquit, quamquam voluptatibus quibusdam est saepe iucundius, tamen expetitur propter voluptatem. Scientiam pollicentur, quam non erat mirum sapientiae cupido patria esse cariorem. Non quaeritur autem quid naturae tuae consentaneum sit, sed quid disciplinae. Ita ne hoc quidem modo paria peccata sunt. Ita prorsus, inquam; Nunc ita separantur, ut disiuncta sint, quo nihil potest esse perversius. Virtutibus igitur rectissime mihi videris et ad consuetudinem nostrae orationis.

Defecerit Sed isti ipsi, qui voluptate et dolore omnia metiuntur, nonne clamant sapienti plus semper adesse quod velit quam quod nolit? Quae quidem sapientes sequuntur duce natura tamquam videntes; Quod enim dissolutum sit, id esse sine sensu, quod autem sine sensu. Sunt omnia Longum est enim ad omnia respondere, quae a te dicta sunt. Nam cui proposito sit conservatio sui, necesse est huic partes quoque sui caras suo genere laudabiles servari.
