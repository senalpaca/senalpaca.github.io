A not-so-ordinary booking system.

The product is a booking system that seems serious at first, where the user has to answer increasingly absurd questions in order to successfully make a booking. Initially, hidden hints can help to find the right answers.

The question topics asked by the bot consist of two parts. One is the introduction to basic knowledge (vaccine information Q&A / vaccine story / self-made stories) and the other is the reservation system. The system was created using Dialogflow by Google.&nbsp;

The main path can be found in the chat flow below.
