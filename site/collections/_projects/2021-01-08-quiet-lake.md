The aim of the project was to explore the social aspect of XR by researching how communication and interaction affect social presence. Specifically, we wanted to determine the minimal communication channels and interaction levels required to ensure social presence in asymmetric environments.

<br>To address this problem, a group of ten students developed a VR game called "the Maze" using Unreal Engine 4, Git, and Oculus Quest 1. The workforce for the implementation of this project was divided into three groups, namely development team, media team and the testing team, in which I also participated.&nbsp;

The game involved two players, an Operator and a Survivor, working together to escape a maze. The Operator communicated with the Survivor, who was in VR, to help them find the right map and password. The game had three 11 minutes rounds, with different communication restrictions in each round. In each round the operator was presented with five different maps of the maze with five different passwords.&nbsp;

To test our solution, we conducted in total of 13 one-hour testing sessions with 25 people that included three 11 minutes game rounds. Each round was followed by a questionnaire and communication rating. We evaluated our results, ran an ANOVA test for significance and found that more interaction improved communication quality, regardless of performance and being immersed in VR helped participants perceive their partner's social presence more accurately.&nbsp;

Overall, our study demonstrated that VR technology can enhance social presence<br>through communication, interaction, and immersion, even in asymmetric environments. This highlights the importance of considering these factors in game design. The most interesting result was that even when communication was limited, players were able to communicate effectively using gestures and emojis.
