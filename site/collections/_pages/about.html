      <p>Hi, I'm Sena Dogan. I am an interdisciplinary developer based in
      Berlin. I am interested in a variety of topics like digital media
      technologies, human rights, film, photography and also their
      intersections.</p><p>For the projects I work on, my main focus is to
      combine important topics with digital architectures and draw a focus on
      environmental, political issues with my implementations. I aim to create
      experiences that trigger multiple sensory stimuli in people. For me this
      means to stay updated and continuously refresh my knowledge about
      different tools and techniques and combine these with my own
      skills.&nbsp;</p>
