      <p>Hi, I'm Sena Dogan. I am an interdisciplinary developer interested in a
      variety of topics like digital media technologies, human rights, film and
      so on.&nbsp;</p><p>For the projects I work on, my main focus is to combine
      important topics with digital architectures and draw a focus on
      environmental, political issues while making art. I aim to create
      experiences that trigger multiple sensory stimuli in people. For me this
      means to stay updated and continuously refresh my knowledge about
      different tools and techniques and combine these with my own
      skills.&nbsp;</p>
